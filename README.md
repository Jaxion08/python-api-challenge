Module 6 Challenge for weather analysis

WeatherPy.ipynb gather weather data from ~600 random cities all over the world and analyzes the weather with scatter plots and linear regression. The scatter plots are saved in output_data. I idn't see any instructions to output the linear regression charts. My interpretation of the results are in the markdown cells in the notebook below each linear regression.

VacationPy.ipynb takes those cities and narrows it down based on conditions I selected. It then finds hotels in a 10,000 meter radius around that city's coordinates and maps those cities out.
